Description: The Module 6 Challenge required that I create a weather dashboard with form inputs. The dashboard must display the date for the upcoming 5 days and each of the five days weather forecast. My two page application was also required to feature a search history tab, that when one of the cities was clicked on, would update the weather dashboard with that cities forecast. To accomplish this, I worked with the openWeatherMap API and Geocoding API. I used the two APIs data in conjunction for this application.
